            Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been 
            stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean 
            towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over 
            the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold 
            that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a 
            laughter more terrible than any sadness a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of 
            the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was 
            the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and 
            the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
            <br></br>
            But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a 
            string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air 
            as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of 
            their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and 
            leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without 
            runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front 
            end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of 
            soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and 
            narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sledâ€”blankets, an axe, and a coffee-
            pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and 
            narrow oblong box.
            <br></br>
            In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a 
            second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over, a man whom 
            the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again. 
            It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is 
            movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to 
            prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their 
            mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into 
            submission man-man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum 
            that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.
            <br></br>
            But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet 
            dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks 
            and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were 
            not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a 
            spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating 
            the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal
            adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and 
            pulseless as the abysses of space.
